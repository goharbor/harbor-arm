Test 7-06 - Immediate trigger  
=======
  
# Purpose:  
  
To verify the immediate replication rule can work as expected. 
  
# References:  
User guide  
  
# Environment:  

* This test requires that at least two Harbor instances are running and available.  
* Create a new replication rule whose triggering condition is set to immediate and no filter is configured.  
  
# Test Steps:  
  
1. Push an image to the project that the replication is applied to.  
2. Login UI as admin user.  
3. In `Administration->Replications` page, edit the rule and make sure the `Delete remote images when locally deleted` is checked.  
4. Delete the image pushed in step 1 on UI.
5. In `Administration->Replications` page, edit the rule and make sure the `Delete remote images when locally deleted` is unchecked.  
6. Push the image to the project that the replication is applied to again.  
7. Delete the image pushed in step 6 on UI.  

# Expect Outcome:  
  
* In step 1, a job should be started and the image should be replicated to the remote registry.
* In step 4, a job should be started and the image should be deleted from the remote registry.
* In step 6, a job should be started and the image should be replicated to the remote registry.
* In step 7, a job should be started and the image should not be deleted from the remote registry.
