# References:

# Environment:
* This test requires that a Harbor instance is running and available.
* Harbor is set to authenticate against a local database. ( auth_mode is set to **db_auth** .) The user data is stored in a local database.
* A linux host with Docker CLI installed (Docker client).
* At least two non-admin users are in Harbor. 

# Test Steps:

1. Assign an non-admin user M with system admin role and act as an admin user. 
2. Repeat all steps in Test 2-21.

# Expected Outcome:

* A user with system admin role can perform all operations the same as the admin user.
