# Environment:

* Harbor is set to authenticate against a local database. ( auth_mode is set to **db_auth** .) The user data is stored in a local database.
* A linux host with Docker CLI installed (Docker client).
* At least three non-admin users are in Harbor. 
* At least one project that admin user is not a member of.

1. Assign an non-admin user M with system admin role and act as an admin user. 
2. Repeat all steps in Test 3-11.

# Expected Outcome:
