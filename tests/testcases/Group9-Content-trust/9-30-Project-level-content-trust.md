project a should be replaced by meaningful and longer name.  

1. Login UI and create a project a.  
2. Push an image to project a.  
3. On Docker client, run  
```sh
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST_SERVER=https://<harbor_ip>:4443
```
and login Harbor.  
4. Push an image to project a.  
5. In project a configuration page, enabled project level content trust.  
6. Pull the image the first time pushed.   
7. Pull the image the second time pushed.
